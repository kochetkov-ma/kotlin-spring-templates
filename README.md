This project integrates Spring Boot Test, core Spring modules, and JUnit 5, demonstrating a standard project layout.
Main feature is maximum speed and minimal dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Minimal Dependencies**: No transitive dependencies. All dependencies are manually specified.
- **Automatic Version Management**: Utilizes Spring Dependency Management and RefreshVersions plugin to handle versioning, eliminating manual version control.
- **High Runtime Performance**: Optimized for fast execution with minimal runtime overhead.
- **Simplified Class Search**: Features a naming convention designed for easy and quick class discovery.
- **Error-Free Setup**: Issues like `NoClassDefinition` errors (missing classes) were resolved by adding the final dependency.

The project ensures fast performance, minimal annotations, and a lightweight configuration.
